## Getting Started

Welcome to the North Sussex Judo Program! This guide will help you get started with writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

In Visual Studio Code, you can manage your dependencies using the JAVA PROJECTS view. This view allows you to easily add, remove, and manage external libraries for your project.

For more details on managing dependencies, please refer to the documentation provided by Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

Now that you have an understanding of the folder structure and dependency management, you're ready to start writing Java code for the North Sussex Judo Program! Dive into the src folder to begin coding and building your judo management application.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to refer to the documentation or reach out to our support team.

Happy coding! ðŸ¥‹ðŸš€
